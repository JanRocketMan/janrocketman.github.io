Hi, I'm Sergey, a first year Master in [Data Science at HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/datasci/), passing an internship in Yandex Research. I used to study [at MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/edu/phystechschools/psami) during my BS.

I'm interested in:

- Deep Generative modeling of any form, modality, color and gender.

- [Semi-supervised](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09170) & [imbalanced learning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-019-0192-5) in vision.

- [Topological Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09949).

- Theoretical Deep Learning from the [Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572) and [weight invariance](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bylx-TNKvH) perspectives.


Occasionally I take part in #apaperaday challenge, writing tiny reviews on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Schmidhoobough). Feel free to comment and join!
