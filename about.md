I'm a four year undergrad at MIPT, currently working as a Data Scientist at ScienceMap, where we try to semantically map & visualize lots of papers to boost researchers productivity. 

Occasionally I take part in #apaperaday challenge, writing tiny reviews in [my twitter](https://www.twitter.com/JanRocks7). Feel free to comment and join!

### Ongoing research projects
- Adversarial defences for Cifar10 and Tiny-ImageNet via hierarcical self-prediction (based on [crowdai challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/nips-2018-adversarial-vision-challenge-robust-model-track))
- TBD
