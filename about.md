I'm a four year undergrad at MIPT, currently working as a Data Scientist at ScienceMap, where we try to semantically map & visualize lots of papers to boost researchers productivity. 

Occasionally I take part in #apaperaday challenge, writing tiny reviews in [my twitter](https://www.twitter.com/JanRocks7). Feel free to comment and join!
