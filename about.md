Hi, I'm Sergey, Master student in [Data Science at HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/datasci/) and Junior Researcher at Yandex.


Some topics I'm interested in:

- Generative Modeling and it's use for Unsupervised Learning (e.g. unsupervised discovery of [interpretable directions in GANs](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/voynov20a.html))

- Theoretical Deep Learning - [understanding benefits of Self-Supervised learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08850), derivation of [novel Generalization measures](https://windowsontheory.org/2020/10/18/understanding-generalization-requires-rethinking-deep-learning/)

- Backpropagation-free DL training (e.g. [Greedy InfoMax](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/851300ee84c2b80ed40f51ed26d866fc-Abstract.html), [Equilibrium Propagation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2017.00024/full))

- Alternatives to Deep Learning in Large-Scale tasks (e.g. [scattering networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJxWS64FwH))

I also enjoy digging through a lot of papers and getting the overall picture of current research.
