Hi, I'm Sergey, a Master student in [Data Science at HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/datasci/) and Junior Researcher at [Yandex](https://research.yandex.com).


Some topics I'm interested in:

- Generative Modeling with applications in Unsupervised Learning (e.g. using StyleGAN for discovery of [interpretable directions](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/voynov20a.html) or [feature extraction](https://genforce.github.io/ghfeat/))

- Theoretical Deep Learning ([understanding benefits of Self-Supervised learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08850), derivation of [novel Generalization measures](https://windowsontheory.org/2020/10/18/understanding-generalization-requires-rethinking-deep-learning/))

- Backpropagation-free DL training (methods such as [Greedy InfoMax](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/851300ee84c2b80ed40f51ed26d866fc-Abstract.html), [Equilibrium Propagation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2017.00024/full))

- Alternatives and simplifications of Deep Learning in Large-Scale tasks (like [Scattering networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJxWS64FwH) or [Neural Tangent Kernels](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/hash/5a4be1fa34e62bb8a6ec6b91d2462f5a-Abstract.html))

I also enjoy digging through a lot of papers and getting the overall picture of current research.
